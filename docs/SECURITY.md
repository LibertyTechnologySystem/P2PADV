# Security Measures

The P2PAdv Blockchain adopts several security measures to maintain a safe environment for all participants.

1. **Penalties and Voting**: In case of malicious activities, penalties can be enforced, causing the offender to lose tokens. Serious offenders can be voted out of the network.
2. **Sybil Attack Prevention**: The system requires PoS participants to stake tokens and PoW participants to provide computational power, preventing Sybil attacks.
3. **Secure Wallet**: Wallets employ asymmetric cryptography for transaction signing and provide backup and restore functionalities with password encryption.
