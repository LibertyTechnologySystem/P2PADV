# Sub-Chains

Sub-chains in P2PAdv are independent chains created by developers for specific use cases such as managing NFTs, tokens, or applications. Developers maintain full control over their sub-chain within the boundaries of network-wide guidelines.

To ensure data integrity, a backup alert system monitors the backup process to the main chain. This system triggers alerts in case of missed backups. Backup related fees are calculated based on the size of the data, backup frequency, and the current network load.
