# Tokenomics

The P2PAdv Blockchain features a carefully designed token economy. Our tokenomics takes into account a range of factors, such as the calculation of transaction fees, rewards for network participation, and rights and benefits for token holders. A key element of our design is the main chain's stable token, which is pegged to the value of the GBP. This choice helps us to provide a fixed low-cost gas fee of 0.002 for developers, making the network more predictable and user-friendly. We have also implemented deflationary or burn mechanisms to maintain a balanced and sustainable economy.

Please note that while the exact charge of the gas fee is fixed, its price in GBP may vary until the mainnet is launched.
