# Consensus Mechanism

The P2PAdv Blockchain uses a hybrid Proof of Work/Proof of Stake consensus mechanism.

In this system, PoS participants, or validators, propose new blocks while PoW participants, or miners, validate these blocks. This approach combines the benefits of both PoW and PoS, balancing the power among different participants, and prevents the network from being dominated by powerful computers or large stakeholders.

The transaction fee distribution is as follows: PoS participants receive 59%, PoW participants receive 40%, and 1% is allocated for further development and network upkeep.
