# Architecture

The P2PAdv Blockchain architecture is designed to support decentralized operations with a main chain and several sub-chains.

## Main Chain

The main chain utilizes a hybrid Proof of Work/Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. This chain manages network-wide operations and maintains an ecosystem for cloud and volunteer computing resources.

## Sub-Chains

Sub-chains are independent chains that developers can create for specific use-cases such as NFTs, tokens, or specialized applications. They operate independently but back up to the main chain at specified intervals for security and data integrity. A dedicated alert system triggers notifications if these backups fail to execute.
