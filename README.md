# P2PAdv Blockchain

The P2PAdv Blockchain is designed to provide a pure p2p resources through a primary chain and several sub-chains. This blockchain uses a hybrid Proof of Work/Proof of Stake consensus mechanism and supports a range of transactions, including token transfers, NFT transfers, and contract executions. The primary chain uses a stable token pegged to the value of the GBP, ensuring fixed low-cost gas fees for developers.

The project is built using Nx, a powerful tool for managing monorepo projects, which allows us to maintain consistency and interdependence between different parts of our codebase.
